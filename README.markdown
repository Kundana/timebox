Timebox
-------

An agile timer, timebox takes care of all the timeboxing for any given feature.

Why?
====

I wanted something to practice [AngularJs](http://angularjs.org) and I figured this would be a fair test to try out the data-binding and watch it scream :). The whole app is run client side.

Install
=======

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/m3talsmith/timebox.git
```

Then open index.html in any browser. It's client side, so you're good to go.
